   | SQUIRTLE - The Browser-based NTLM Attack Toolkit |
   |   version 1.0 - DefCon release (August, 2008)    |
   +--------------------------------------------------+

The purpose of this little doodad is to help you prove to your employer, your
client, your best friend, your dog, or God that NTLM is truly dead. It does
this by taking control of any browser that comes into contact with it and
making it perform NTLM authentication at will. By using a set of API calls
you can imbed Squirtle into existing penetration toolkits, proxies or other
fun tools at your disposal.

Requirements
------------

  o  Metasploit 3 Framework
  o  Ruby language interpreter (1.8.6 tested)
  o  Rubygems:
     o  SQLite3
     o  ActiveRecord
  o  Be INSIDE a corporate network

Why Inside?
-----------

NTLM Authentication from web browsers occurs when a user connects to a
URL that the browser believes is within a trusted internet zone (for
Internet Explorer). Mozilla FireFox can be configured to deliver NTLM
authentication based upon hostnames or masks.

While there have been methods of forcing the browser to believe it's
connected to a lower-security zone using Flash objects or Java applets
they typically revolve around deficiencies within the languages and are
eventually patched.

Using Squirtle
--------------

Running Squirtle is easy:

 Step 1: Modify squirtle.yaml to suit your configuration
 Step 2: "ruby squirtle.rb"
 Step 3: Point browsers towards http://yourserver:8080/

What to do after that depends upon you.

 Option 1: Crack the LM or NTLM hashes with static nonce
 Option 2: Use Rainbowtables on the LM hashes with static nonce
 Option 3: Combine Squirtle with your own proxy code using the Squirtle API
 Option 4: Make cookies!


WARNING! ACHTUNG!
-----------------

Like most security tools, it can be used for good or evil. If you try to use
it within your enterprise without approval from your management, you may have
created a "resume generating" event for yourself. Get the approval you need
before treading further.

Support and Enhancements
------------------------

This is free software and will be supported and enhanced as I have time. Any
patches submitted will be graciously reviewed and applied if applicable.
