#summary Design of Squirtle and its API.

= Squirtle's Design =

The idea behind Squirtle is to generate NTLM authorization requests at will from a client. The client is managed by a series of JSON calls back to the master controller which also receives requests from outside utilities to facilitate the passage of authorization parameters.

Through the use of the SAPI (Squirtle API) any program can obtain a list of controlled workstations, request NTLM authentication with a set of parameters (passing the server's nonce) or shut clients down if necessary.

= Squirtle API =

All requests can be sent as GET or POST structure

== Attacker Functions ==

=== Authentication - _Not active yet_ ===

All requesters must first authenticate to the master controller and obtain a session key.

|| *Request* || *URI* || http://server/controller/auth ||
|| *Variables* ||  *USER* || username for authentication ||
|| || *PASS* || password for authentication ||
|| *Returns* || *SQUIRTLESESS* || cookie with authentication key ||

=== List Clients ===

Controller function to list clients currently connected.

|| *Request* || *URI* || http://server/controller/listclients ||
|| *Variables* || None ||
|| *Returns* || JSON || list of clients, sorted by timestamp ||

=== List Hashes ===

Controller function to list all collected users and hashes with nonces.

|| *Request* || *URI* || http://server/controller/listhashes ||
|| *Variables* || None ||
|| *Returns* || JSON || User hashes, unsorted ||

=== Request Static NONCE NTLM Auth ===

Request that a user authenticate with a static NONCE. Results are stored in the
hashes database.

|| *Request* || *URI* || http://server/controller/static ||
|| *Variables* || ClientID || ClientID Number ||
||             || Nonce || Nonce to use (as hex string) -- will use default if not listed ||
|| *Returns* || JSON || 'status':'ok' || request processing, valid user ||
||           ||      || 'status':'invalid user' || invalid user ||

=== Request NTLM Type 3 Response ===

Request a user respond to a specific Type 2 request. Attacker can submit a
base64 Type 2 request or the specific variables to use. Any client that has
not talked to the controller in 5 minutes (configurable) will be considered
dead. Any requests will return 'invalid user'.

|| *Request* || *URI* || http://server/controller/type3 ||
|| *Variables* || ClientID || ClientID Number ||
||  _USE_      || || ||
||             || base64 || Base64 of a Type 2 message ||
||  _OR_       || || ||
||             || domain || Domain name ||
||             || server || Server name ||
||             || dns_domain || DNS suffix ||
||             || nonce || Nonce (as hex string) ||
|| *Returns* || JSON || 'status':'ok' || request processed ||
||           ||      || 'status':'invalid user' || invalid user! ||
||           ||      || 'status':'no response'  || no response from client ||
||           ||      || 'type3':base64_type3    || Type 3 message base64 encoded ||

== Client Functions ==

Clients are first captured by connecting to the server root (http://server/).

=== Keepalive ===

This is the basic command and control block. As a new client connects the 
controlling html/javascript code will be delivered. After a pre-configured
timeout value, the client will poll the master controller for commands to
process.

|| *Request* || *URI* || http://server/keepalive ||
|| *Variables* || None ||
|| *Returns* || JSON || 'keepalive': '5000' || check back in 5 seconds ||
|| || || 'url': 'http://server/url' | 'nil'	|| load url if exist ||
|| || || 'refresh': 'http://url' | 'nil' || refresh iframe ||

=== Static NONCE NTLM Authorization ===

Force client to authenticate to master controller with a static nonce to
collect hash. This only supports LMv1/NTLMv1 as a client-side nonce adds
to the complexity of the hashes for cracking. If the client does not 
support NTLMv1 negotiation then we're outta luck for this version.

|| *Request* || *URI* || http://server/client/auth ||
|| *Variables* || None ||
|| *Returns* || JSON || 'return':'true' ||

=== Server NONCE NTLM Authorization ===

Force client to authenticate to master controller with a server-defined
nonce and return the result to the requester. Support for NTLMv2 included
as we're just passing the authorization request and have no need to store
for cracking.

|| *Request* || *URI* || http://server/client/nonce ||
|| *Variables* || None ||
|| *Returns* || *JSON* || 'return':'true' ||
