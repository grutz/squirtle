The files in this directory are included for the convenience of all packagers
of ntlmaps on any platform.  Please feel free to contribute if you can see
enhancements or improvements to be made.  Directory contents so far:
ntlmaps.spec -- Distribution-neutral RPM .spec file.  Currently only
                vaguely FHS compliant.
compile.py   -- Basic wrapper of compileall.compile_dir() for convenience
                of RPM builders.
setup.py     -- Script for building standalone ntlmaps distributables with
                py2exe on Windows (execute out of base directory as:
                python packaging\setup.py).
ntlmaps.nsi  -- NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Installer) configuration for
                turning py2exe'ed ntlmaps into a pretty installer for
                Windows.
